**Summary:**

After more than three decades, Foot and Mouth disease has reemerged in Indonesia. As of July 10th, 2022, the PMK task force reported that 329,829 head of livestock had been infected with PMK, with outbreaks spreading to 22 provinces and 216 regencies/cities throughout Indonesia. The majority of livestock affected by PMK are cattle, with 320,196 infected, which amounts to 97% of the total national livestock population affected by PMK. The Ministry of Agriculture's Directorate General of Livestock and Animal Health recorded 12,800 cattle deaths due to this PMK outbreak in 2022. Hence, our team proposed to build a Machine Learning model to monitor FMD in Cattle.  Our mobile application will use a userâ€™s camera to take the foot and mouth images that will be identified. After capturing the image, our application will show the percentage of animals infected with foot and mouth diseases (FMD) and history track vaccines from cattle.
